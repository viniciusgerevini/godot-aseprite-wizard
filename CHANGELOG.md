## 1.0.0 (2020-09-03)

Initial release

### Added

- Creates SpriteFrames with Atlas Texture to be used in AnimatedSprites.
- Separate each Aseprite Tag as its own animation. In case no tags are defined, import everything as default animation.
- Converts Aseprite frame duration (defined in milliseconds) to Godot's animation FPS. This way you can create your animation with the right timing in Aseprite, and it should work the same way in Godot.
- Choose to export Aseprite file as single SpriteFrames resource, or separate each layer as its own resource.
- Filter out layers you don't want in the final animation, using regex.
- Supports Aseprite animation direction (forward, reverse, ping-pong)
